Vincent Bernat's fvwm configuration
-----------------------------------

This my fvwm configuration. You need to install `fvwm-crystal` to make
it work.  An interesting functionality is the good handling of
Xinerema/multi-head setups. 

You need to create two directories:
 - `wallpapers/` which contain your favorite wallpapers
 - `screenshots/` which will get your screenshots

Look at `scripts/build-wallpaper.py` and try to run it by hand to
check that you have everything needed to build wallpapers.
